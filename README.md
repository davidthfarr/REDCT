# RED-CT: Using LLM-labeled Data to Train and Deploy Edge Classifiers

This repository contains the code for [RED-CT: A Systems Design Methodology to Using LLM-labeled Data to Train and Deploy Edge Classifiers for Computational Social Science](./TODO_add_path).

The repo is organized as follows:
- `./data/` contains benchmark datasets.
- `./scripts/` contains examples for running the full systems methodology.
- `./src/` contains the code for research and development.
    - `./src/edge/` contains code for training and testing models for edge deployment.
    - `./src/llm_label/` contains code for using LLMs to label data.

## Methodology Flow

We provide a few command line tools to make implementing and evaluation easier. All of these scripts are designed to run from this directory. We also provide some examples scripts in the scripts directory.

### LLM Labeling

### Classifier Training for Edge Deployment

### Edge Model Evaluation and Testing

## Data

A note about all the datasets and their sources.
