# RED-CT: A Systems Design Methodology to Using LLM-labeled Data to Train and Deploy Edge Classifiers for Computational Social Science

This repository contains the code for [RED-CT: A Systems Design Methodology to Using LLM-labeled Data to Train and Deploy Edge Classifiers for Computational Social Science](google.com).

The repo is organized as follows:
- `./src/` contains the code for research and development.
    - `./src/edge/` contains code for training and testing models for edge deployment.
    - `./src/hub/` contains code for using LLMs to label data.
- `./data/` contains benchmark datasets.
- `./scripts/` contains scripts for running the full systems methodology and experiments.

## Methodology Flow

We provide a few command line tools to make implementing and evaluation easier. All of these scripts are designed to run from this directory. We also provide some examples scripts in the scripts directory.

### LLM Labeling At 'the Hub'

### Classifier Training for Edge Deployment

### Model Evaluation and Testing
